# Perec

# This has not been maintained in any way as I have moved away from Pelican as my blog host. - Archiving Data.

Perec is an evolving modification of the [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/giulivo/pelican-svbhack) theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) with influences from [Eston Theme by mikedidthis](https://themeforest.net/item/eston-a-simple-notebook-theme/9497657) which was written for [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org).

It has designed for my site and still rather rough in some areas.

You are welcome to look at my mess; however, this not roll-out ready.

## DEMO Site

You can view the theme at [Text and Hubris](http://www.textandhubris.com/).
